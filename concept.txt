SoundLight, a synopsis:
Sets of coloured spotlights and a microphone are set up at regular intervals on either side of a corridor.
Sound, or music, made by passersby is received by the microphone, and processed to detect pitch of as many notes (see frequencies) as there are lights.
The sound frequencies are converted to light wavelengths and displayed with the coloured spotlights.
This conversion and the spacing of the spotlights can be altered for different results.
